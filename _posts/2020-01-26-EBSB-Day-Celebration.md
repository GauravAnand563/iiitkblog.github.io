Since its first inception by the Honourable Prime Minister Sri Narendra Modi on 31st October, 2016,
to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Indian Institute of
Information Technology, Kalyani has always been geared up fully, responding to the holistic
endeavour of the Government to make it a reality by planning to organize an event to celebrated the
– ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ or the EBSB day.
This is an opportunity to make our people aware about the seamless integral hull of the Modern
Indian State spread across a vast landmass on whose firm foundations, the geo-political strength of
the country is ensured to benefit one and all.
Our country has diverse cultures and rich cultural heritage in each of them. The cultural exchange
programs will help us admire and appreciate our cultures mutually and thus, build a sense of
togetherness and bonding. If a finger is cut, its not the finger alone that feels the pain, its the whole
body that feels it. National integration, irrespective of the regions that we hail from, is of vital
importance, since the key to our progress is hidden in our unity amidst our diversity. The series of
events that our institute plans to conduct under ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ programme will
strengthen our unity and help us all build a stronger and better India.
The Following events will be organised to mark this special day to celebrate the idea of India as a
nation wherein different cultural units across varied geographies coalesce and interact with each
other, this glorious manifestation of diverse cuisine, music, dance, theatre, movies & films,
handicrafts, sports, literature, festivals, painting, sculpture etc. will enable people to imbibe the
innate chord of binding and brotherhood.
