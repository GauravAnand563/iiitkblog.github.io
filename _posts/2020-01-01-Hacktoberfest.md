The event started with the members of Free And Open Source Club (FOSC) of IIIT Kalyani introducing the students to the beautiful world of Open Source Software Development. 

The students were introduced to the git workflow and taught how to create GitHub account, how to fork and clone repositories, and how to make a pull request.

FOSC IIIT Kalyani made the students enroll in  "HactoberFest 2019", an event sponsored by GitHub and DigitalOcean. The students actively participated in the event and made several PRs, thus contributing to Open Source.

Prizes were given to students who made the first meaningful pull request and the most number of meaningful pull request throughout the day. 

In total, the event was a huge success and many more such events like Kalyani Vacation of Code are expected in the future from FOSC IIIT Kalyani.
