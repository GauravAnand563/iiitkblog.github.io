“When witches go riding,

and black cats are seen,

the moon laughs and whispers,

‘tis near Halloween”.

The students of IIIT Kalyani, successfully organized Treasure Hunt based on the theme of Halloween. This Halloween, when the moonlight shone past the ghastly compound of IIIT Kalyani, the future engineers were seen hunting a hidden prize by following special signs(clues) which had been hidden at different places in the campus.

The event was marked with great zeal among the participants, who tried their best to decipher the cryptic messages on their path to the next clues.

A total of 24 teams had participated in the Treasure Hunt and the victorious team was 'Flying Pirates'.

Overwhelmed by the enthusiasm, we are looking to organise events like online treasure hunt and capture the flags in the near future.
