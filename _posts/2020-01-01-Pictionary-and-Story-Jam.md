The literary committee of IIIT Kalyani, Udaan, successfully organized two fun-filled yet enriching literary events on 23rd October. This event marked an important transition as the first-year students of Udaan family took the center stage and organized the event.

Pictionary, wherein a team member draws the image of, or related to the word given to him by the hosts, and the other team members had to guess the correct word.

Another was story jam, which involved two partners crafting out a story line-by-line, in turn, beginning with a prompt phrase given by the hosts.

Both the events were welcomed with double the enthusiasm and active participation. Udaan hopes to continue with the tradition of bringing fun into the classroom via similar events.
